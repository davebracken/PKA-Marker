# ExApp XML file.

*pka_marker.pta* needs to be copied to a *PKA_Marker* subdirectory in the Packet Tracer *extensions* subdirectory as per step 2 of the [installations](https://github.com/davebracken/PKA-Marker/tree/main#installation) section.

*pka_marker.pta* is the encrypted version of *pka_marker.xml* which was created by Packet Tracer's meta.exe utility.  
See [Modifying the ExApp XML meta file](https://github.com/davebracken/PKA-Marker/tree/main#modifying-the-exapp-xml-meta-file) for details.
